Q: web editor. wut.

now I can't push I bet.


![Points bar](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/points-bar.svg)



Link to text file
-----------------
This is generated by [[./.github/workflows/scores.yml]]. You can click on the link to see the text there, but I have not found a way to show it directly.

[Scores](../../blob/scores/.github/scores.txt)


Turn text to image
------------------

![image score](../../blob/scores/.github/scores.png)

I was not able to get imagemagick to work here in converting text to images. There is a mogrify command, but it seems to have some security policy setup that prevents it from working. Maybe there is a way to make it work, but I did not find it.
